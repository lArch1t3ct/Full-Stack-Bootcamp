        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate individual with a problem-solving attitude and a strong advocate for the use of technology to provide solutions.<br />
            Having almost a 5-year experience in the cybersecurity field assuming roles from L1 SOC analyst and security researcher to<br />
            penetration testing and red teaming, I realized that I am more interested in building things and applying my creativity rather than<br />
            pointing fingers to weaknesses and trying to exploit them.<br/>
            Hence, I am pursuing a career as a front-end engineer.
